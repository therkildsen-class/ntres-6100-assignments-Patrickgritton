# Assignment 9: Functions and factors

<br>

**1.1 Write a function that can convert Fahrenheit to Celsius**, based on the following fomula: `C = (F - 32) * 5 / 9`

##answer

``` r
f_to_c <- function(fahrenheit) {
  celsius <- (fahrenheit - 32) * 5 / 9
  return(celsius)
}
```

Take your function for a spin, does it return the correct values?

32 F = 0 C

``` r
f_to_c(32)
```

## It does return the correct value!

50 F = 10 C

``` r
f_to_c(50)
```

##returns the right one here, too!

```         
## [1] 10
```

212 F = 100 C

``` r
f_to_c(212)
```

##yep!

```         
## [1] 100
```

**1.2** A student came from ‘tropical Canada’. She doesn’t like the cold but she really didn’t like it when it’s hot. Although she wanted to know what the temperature is in Celsius when the US weather channel reported it in Fahrenheit, there are certain points at which it was just too cold or too hot for to to care about the exact value. **Modify the f_to_c function below to print the following**, and check if your function works properly using the input of **-10 F, 60 F, and 90 F**.

-   If the temperature is less than -20 C, print “Don’t bother going out.”

-   If the temperature is greater than 30 C, print “I’m moving back to Canada.”

-   If the temperature is between -20 C and 30 C, print the temperature in Celsius.

The following is how it should work:

``` r
f_to_c_message(-10)
```

```         
## [1] "Don't bother going out."
```

``` r
f_to_c_message(60)
```

```         
## [1] 15.55556
```

``` r
f_to_c_message(90)
```

```         
## [1] "I'm moving back to Canada."
```

##answer:

``` r
f_to_c_message <- function(fahrenheit) {
  celsius <- (fahrenheit - 32) * 5 / 9
  if (celsius < -10) {
    return("Dont bother going out.")
  } else if (celsius > 30) {
    return("I'm going back to canada!")
  } else {
    return(celsius)
  }}
```

## Exercise 2: Set operation

The R function `setdiff(x,y)` returns the elements of a vector x that are not in y. For example, say x is a list of singers who can reach very high registers, and y is a list of musicians who died in 2016. `setdiff(x, y)` would return a list of singers with high voices who did not die in 2016.

``` r
x <- c("prince", "mj", "sam cook", "whitney", "dolly")
y <- c("sharon jones", "prince", "bowie", "leonard cohen", "phife dawg")
setdiff(x,y)
```

```         
## [1] "mj"       "sam cook" "whitney"  "dolly"
```

However, sometimes you want a function to return the elements that are in x or y but not both. Here, **write such a function**, and use your custom function to **find the names of singers who either have high voices, but did not die in 2016, OR who died in 2016 but do not have high voices.**

Your function will need to work for any vectors, not just the ones in this example. The output should be a single vector, not two vectors.

**Hint**: you will need R’s [set operations](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/sets.html).

The following is how it should work:

``` r
#Example output
unique_element(x,y)
```

```         
## [1] "mj"            "sam cook"      "whitney"       "dolly"        
## [5] "sharon jones"  "bowie"         "leonard cohen" "phife dawg"
```

##answer

``` r
symmetric_diff <- function(x, y) {
  only_in_x <- setdiff(x, y)
  only_in_y <- setdiff(y, x)
  result <- c(only_in_x, only_in_y)
  return(result)
}
```

``` r
symmetric_diff(x, y)
```

## Exercise 3: Fuel Efficiency of Car Models

This exercise uses the `mtcars` dataset, which is available in base R. It was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973–74 models). Let’s first convert `mtcars` to tibble format such that the row names become a column named “model”.

``` r
mtcars_tbl <- as_tibble(mtcars, rownames = "model")
mtcars_tbl %>%
  head() %>%
  kable()
```

| model             |  mpg | cyl | disp |  hp | drat |    wt |  qsec |  vs |  am | gear | carb |
|:------------------|-----:|----:|-----:|----:|-----:|------:|------:|----:|----:|-----:|-----:|
| Mazda RX4         | 21.0 |   6 |  160 | 110 | 3.90 | 2.620 | 16.46 |   0 |   1 |    4 |    4 |
| Mazda RX4 Wag     | 21.0 |   6 |  160 | 110 | 3.90 | 2.875 | 17.02 |   0 |   1 |    4 |    4 |
| Datsun 710        | 22.8 |   4 |  108 |  93 | 3.85 | 2.320 | 18.61 |   1 |   1 |    4 |    1 |
| Hornet 4 Drive    | 21.4 |   6 |  258 | 110 | 3.08 | 3.215 | 19.44 |   1 |   0 |    3 |    1 |
| Hornet Sportabout | 18.7 |   8 |  360 | 175 | 3.15 | 3.440 | 17.02 |   0 |   0 |    3 |    2 |
| Valiant           | 18.1 |   6 |  225 | 105 | 2.76 | 3.460 | 20.22 |   1 |   0 |    3 |    1 |

From `mtcars_tbl`, reproduce the following plot, which shows the miles per gallon (`mpg`) of car models on the x axis (see hints below). Different models are ordered on the y axis according to their `mpg` and their names are shown next to the data points. Also, the size of each data point maps to its horse power (`hp`), and the color maps to number of cylinders (`cyl`).

<br>

#factor reorder the data by mpg

``` r
mtcars_tbl <- as_tibble(mtcars, rownames = "model")
mtcars_tbl <- mtcars_tbl %>%
  mutate(model = fct_reorder(model, mpg))
```

#make the plot

``` r
ggplot(mtcars_tbl, aes(x = mpg, y = model, size = hp, color = as.factor(cyl))) + 
geom_point() + 
geom_text(aes(label = model), hjust = -0.1, size = 3) +
xlim(8, 40) + 
labs(title = "Miles Per Gallon of Car Models", x = "Fuel Consumption in Miles per Gallon (mpg)", y = "Car Model", color = "Number of Cylinders", size = "Horse Power (hp)") + 
theme( axis.title.y = element_blank(), axis.text.y = element_blank(), axis.ticks.y = element_blank())
```

#### **Reflection Questions:**

<br>

#### In this assignment, you wrote functions that operate on vectors (Exercises 1 and 2) and manipulated a data frame to create a plot (Exercise 3). Explain the difference between a simple character vector (like the one for singers) and a factor (like the model column). Why was it necessary to treat the model column as a factor and reorder its levels to create the final plot?

To my understanding, the model column had to be in factor format in order to re-order it based on the values in mpg. If both were vectors, I don't think there is a simple way to re-order the values of one vector using the values of another within a ggplot plot (Whereas you can just use fct_reorder if it's a factor).

<br>

#### Identify one of the three exercises where you used an AI assistant to help generate or debug a chunk of code. Provide the specific prompt you used. Then, show the code before you finalized it (e.g., the AI's initial suggestion or your first attempt) and the final, working code. In your commentary, explain what was missing or incorrect in the "before" version and what you learned by testing and correcting it to produce the final version.

Excersize 3:

prompt:

``` r
mtcars_tbl <- as_tibble(mtcars, rownames = "model")
mtcars_tbl %>%
  head() %>%
  kable()
```

given the dataset mtcars_tbl, write code in ggplot which creates a plot that shows the miles per gallon (mpg) of car models on the x axis. Different models (model) are ordered on the y axis according to their mpg and their names are shown next to the data points. Also, the size of each data point maps to its horse power (hp), and the color maps to number of cylinders (cyl).

Copilot code:

``` r
ggplot(mtcars_tbl, aes(x = mpg, y = model, size = hp, color = as.factor(cyl))) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_text(aes(label = model), hjust = -0.1, size = 3) +
  labs(title = "Miles Per Gallon of Car Models",
       x = "Miles Per Gallon (mpg)",
       y = "Car Model",
       color = "Number of Cylinders",
       size = "Horse Power (hp)") +
  theme_minimal()
```

Changes:

1.  had to write a seperate code chunk to reorder the model factor by mpg

2.  had to edit the theme to remove the y axis and associated plot elements

3.   Had to manually change the range of the x axis

Final code:

``` r
ggplot(mtcars_tbl, aes(x = mpg, y = model, size = hp, color = as.factor(cyl))) + 
geom_point() + 
geom_text(aes(label = model), hjust = -0.1, size = 3) +
xlim(8, 40) + 
labs(title = "Miles Per Gallon of Car Models", x = "Fuel Consumption in Miles per Gallon (mpg)", y = "Car Model", color = "Number of Cylinders", size = "Horse Power (hp)") + 
theme( axis.title.y = element_blank(), axis.text.y = element_blank(), axis.ticks.y = element_blank())
```

Through editing and correcting copilot's code, I learned a few things. Firstly, I learned the strengths and limitations of copilot when applied to ggplot (mainly that it struggles when given lots of instructions and is much better at producing a skeleton plot which can be easily edited). I also learned how to use theme arguments to remove the Y axis, and how to manually change the x axis range. This excersize really helped me learn to use copilot more effectively and accountably, and not resort to basic and mindless vibe-coding to kludge fixes for my problems.
